; SD/block storage registers (see sdcard.asm). SD_LBA is a single 16-bit
; register (STX/LDX-friendly: high byte at +0, low byte at +1, matching the
; 6309's natural big-endian STX order) rather than two separately-named
; byte registers. Block numbers are 32 bits: SD_LBA is the LOW word, and the
; high word is latched into the device by the SETHI command (SD_LBA = the high
; word, then SD_CMDSTA = SD_CMD_SETHI). It stays latched until the next SETHI
; (and is 0 after reset), so a driver that only wants the first 32MB never
; needs to touch it.

; native-mode register stacking order: PC,U,Y,X,DP,F,E,B,A,CC pushed in that
; order, so CC ends up nearest the post-entry S. A BIOS call handler (see
; devio.asm) reads its arguments from these offsets and, since RTI restores
; registers FROM this frame rather than from whatever's live in the CPU at
; the time, must write any return values back to these same offsets before
; returning -- leaving a result only in a live register is silently lost.
